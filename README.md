Repo is created and currently is featured to ensure the datatype transformation to eggplant code safe. And the test procedure is that:
1. generate .rs from all .egg file in test folder migrated from egglog
      `cargo run --example eggplant_example`
2. try build the .rs as single file rust project
3. try run the binary generated by .rs and test the assertions
     `cargo run --bin compile_test` 



# How to transform single *.egg file to *.rs ?

```rust
cargo run --example eggplant_example -- --file ./code.lisp
```
