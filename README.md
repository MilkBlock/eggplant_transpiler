# eggplant_transpiler

transform egglog into rust native eggplant code

Repo is created and currently is featured to ensure the datatype transformation to eggplant code safe. And the test procedure is that:
1. generate .rs from all .egg file in test folder migrated from egglog
      `cargo run --example eggplant_example`
3. try build the .rs as single file rust project
4. try run the binary generated by .rs and test the assertions
     `cargo run --bin compile_test`

It would take some time to pass %90 of tests
